=================

This is the repository for a project developed for Raspberry Pi and NXT Lego
robots at http://www.hackathon.ro/event/ event.

Project Name
============

taram-taram-taram

Short Description
=================

Starting from a JPG/JPEG image which is analyzed and segmented using OpenCV
by the Raspberry PI stack, we want to make an NXT Lego robot draw a sketch
of said file.

Data is transmitted between PI board and NXT board only via Bluetooth.

The obtained image is an abstract art of the original one. Don't expect a
perfect clone, there will be none :)
