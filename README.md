=================

This is the repository for a project developed for Raspberry Pi and NXT Lego
robots at http://www.hackathon.ro/event/ event.

* Project Name: taram-taram-taram
* Short Description:

> Starting from a JPG/JPEG image which is analyzed and segmented using OpenCV
> by the Raspberry PI stack, we want to make an NXT Lego robot draw a sketch
> of said file.
>
> Data is transmitted between PI board and NXT board only via Bluetooth.
>
> The obtained image is an abstract art of the original one. Don't expect a
> perfect clone, there will be none :)
